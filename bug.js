This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that returns a 404 error.  The component doesn't always handle this gracefully, sometimes leading to crashes or blank spaces in the UI, without providing clear error messages. This is particularly problematic because the typical error handling methods for network requests don't consistently work as expected with Expo's `Image` component.
